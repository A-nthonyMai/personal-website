## Overview
This is the repository for my personal website - [Anto.au](https://anto.au).

I've created this website using React and Typescript and used TailwindCSS to do the styling.

I have also the [Next.js](http://nextjs.org) JavaScript framework to build this application as it allowed me to quickly and more easily build the application.

This application is hosted using the [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) platform.
